<span style="color:yellow">**FizzBuzz:**</span> 
_______
Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100,
with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the
number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.
When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz" for
numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz".
